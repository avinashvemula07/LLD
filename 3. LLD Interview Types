# Low-Level Design (LLD) Interview Formats

### A Complete Overview

Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews are often misunderstood. Many candidates prepare deeply for one format—usually Object-Oriented Design—only to discover that the interview tests a completely different skill set.

**LLD is not a single interview type.**
Companies evaluate LLD skills using multiple formats, each designed to assess different engineering competencies.

For example:

* A whiteboard OOD round at **Amazon** looks nothing like
* A machine coding round at **Flipkart**, or
* A concurrency-focused round at **Uber**

This section introduces the **five most common LLD interview formats**, explains what each evaluates, and helps you identify which format you are likely to face.

---

## The Five Common LLD Interview Formats

1. **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**
2. **Machine Coding**
3. **Concurrency Design**
4. **API Design**
5. **Schema Design**

Each format has its own expectations, deliverables, and evaluation criteria. Preparing for the wrong one is a common reason for rejection.

> **Course Focus**
> This course primarily covers:
>
> * Object-Oriented Design
> * Machine Coding
> * Concurrency Design
>
> API Design and Schema Design are typically covered as part of High-Level System Design (HLD) interviews and will be discussed briefly where relevant.

## 1. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

Object-Oriented Design is the most common LLD interview format at large technology companies such as **Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft**.

In an OOD interview, you are asked to design a system by identifying:

* Classes and interfaces
* Attributes and methods
* Relationships between objects

The emphasis is on **design thinking and communication**, not on writing executable code.

### Format

* **Duration:** 45–60 minutes
* **Tools:** Whiteboard, shared document, or virtual whiteboard
* **Code:** Pseudocode or skeleton classes (not runnable)
* **Deliverables:**

  * Class diagrams
  * Interface definitions
  * Key method signatures
* **Interaction:** High (continuous discussion with the interviewer)

### What Interviewers Evaluate

| Skill              | Importance | Evaluation Criteria                       |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| OOP Fundamentals   | High       | Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  |
| Design Patterns    | High       | Recognizing when patterns apply naturally |
| SOLID Principles   | High       | SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP                   |
| Communication      | High       | Clear explanation of decisions            |
| Trade-off Analysis | Medium     | Ability to justify and revise choices     |

## 2. Machine Coding

Machine coding interviews require you to write **fully working, runnable code** under strict time constraints. This format is especially common at **Indian tech companies and startups**.

There is no pseudocode or hand-waving. Your code must:

* Compile
* Run
* Produce correct output

### Format

* **Duration:** 60–90 minutes (sometimes up to 2 hours)
* **Tools:** Local IDE or online coding platform
* **Deliverable:** Working code
* **Evaluation:** Offline code review after submission
* **Interaction:** Low (mostly independent work)

### What Interviewers Evaluate

| Skill              | Importance | Evaluation Criteria             |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Coding Speed       | High       | Ability to implement quickly    |
| Code Quality       | High       | Readability, maintainability    |
| Correctness        | High       | Passes all test cases           |
| Testing            | High       | Test cases or driver code       |
| Project Structure  | Medium     | Separation of concerns          |
| Edge Case Handling | Medium     | Input validation and robustness |

### Best Practices

* Start with **core functionality first**
* Handle **input/output early**
* Write **simple, testable code**
* Test incrementally; do not wait until the end
* Avoid premature optimization or overengineering

## 3. Concurrency Design

Concurrency design interviews assess your ability to build **thread-safe systems**. These interviews are common at companies that work on high-performance, distributed, or real-time systems.

You may be asked to:

* Design thread-safe components
* Identify race conditions
* Implement synchronization strategies

### Format

* **Duration:** 60–90 minutes
* **Tools:** Whiteboard + code (commonly Java or C++)
* **Deliverable:** Thread-safe design and implementation
* **Focus Areas:** Correctness, safety, and performance

### What Interviewers Evaluate

| Skill                      | Importance | Evaluation Criteria                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Race Condition Detection   | High       | Identifying unsafe shared state           |
| Synchronization Primitives | High       | Correct use of locks, mutexes, semaphores |
| Deadlock Prevention        | High       | Understanding deadlock conditions         |
| Correctness Reasoning      | High       | Proving thread safety                     |
| Performance Awareness      | Medium     | Lock granularity and contention           |

### Best Practices

* Identify **shared mutable state first**
* Choose synchronization primitives intentionally
* Avoid deadlocks by design
* Balance correctness with performance
* Explain *why* your solution is safe

## 4. API Design

API design interviews focus on creating **clean, intuitive interfaces** that other developers will use.

The emphasis is on:

* Method signatures
* Contracts
* Usability and consistency

Internal implementation details are usually out of scope.

### Format

* **Duration:** 30–45 minutes
* **Tools:** Whiteboard or shared document
* **Deliverables:**

  * API endpoints or method signatures
  * Request/response formats
  * Error handling strategy
* **Interaction:** High

### What Interviewers Evaluate

| Skill           | Importance | Evaluation Criteria              |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Usability       | High       | Easy to use correctly            |
| Consistency     | High       | Naming and parameter conventions |
| Extensibility   | Medium     | Backward compatibility           |
| Error Handling  | Medium     | Clear errors and contracts       |
| REST Principles | Medium     | Resource modeling and HTTP usage |

## 5. Schema Design

Schema design interviews test your ability to model data efficiently and correctly. These questions often appear as part of system design interviews.

### Format

* **Duration:** 30–45 minutes
* **Tools:** Whiteboard or ER diagrams
* **Deliverables:**

  * Tables and columns
  * Relationships and constraints
  * Indexing strategy

### What Interviewers Evaluate

| Skill          | Importance | Evaluation Criteria             |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Data Modeling  | High       | Correct entity relationships    |
| Normalization  | High       | Appropriate normalization level |
| Constraints    | High       | Primary keys, foreign keys      |
| Indexing       | Medium     | Query-driven indexes            |
| Query Patterns | Medium     | Read/write efficiency           |

## How to Identify Your LLD Interview Type

### 1. Ask Your Recruiter

This is the most reliable approach.

Recommended questions:

* “What type of LLD round should I expect?”
* “Will this be whiteboard-based or IDE-based?”
* “How long is the LLD round?”
* “Should I expect concurrency topics?”
* “Will database or schema design be involved?”

### 2. Use Company Signals

| Company Type                    | Likely LLD Focus          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Big Tech (US)                   | Object-Oriented Design    |
| Indian consumer tech / startups | Machine Coding            |
| Fintech / trading               | Concurrency & performance |
| B2B SaaS                        | API Design                |
| Database / analytics companies  | Schema Design             |

## Key Takeaway

**LLD interviews are not uniform.**
Success depends on identifying the interview format early and preparing specifically for the skills it tests.

> Preparing deeply for the wrong LLD format is one of the most common—and avoidable—interview mistakes.

If you want, I can next:

* Add **practice problems** per LLD type
* Create **checklists** for each interview format
* Convert this into **slides or PDFs**
* Align it to **specific company interview patterns**

Just tell me how you plan to use it.
